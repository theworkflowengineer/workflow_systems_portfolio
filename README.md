# Workflow Systems Portfolio

This repository documents how I design automation systems focused on:
- Reliability
- Failure handling
- Observability
- Scale

These are not templates or tutorials.

They are system-level designs used in real-world automation environments.

## What you'll find here
- End-to-end workflow system designs
- Failure and recovery strategies
- Operational visibility patterns

## What you won't find
- Plug-and-play workflows
- Credentials or secrets
- Client-specific logic

If you're evaluating automation for production use, this repository shows how I think.
